ðŸ›’ Sales Forecasting and Demand Prediction
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to build a robust machine learning pipeline to forecast product demand based on historical sales data. Accurate demand forecasting helps businesses make data-driven decisions in inventory management, marketing strategies, and staffing.

ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project?
Inaccurate demand forecasting can lead to:

Overstocking or Understocking â†’ Causing financial losses and inefficiencies

Inefficient Marketing â†’ Misallocation of promotional budgets

Operational Disruptions â†’ Misjudging demand can harm the supply chain

âœ… Project Outcomes
Improved Forecast Accuracy

Optimized Inventory Management

Enhanced Business Strategy

ðŸš€ Project Pipeline
We followed a complete data science workflow:

Data Visualization

Explored relationships between columns using visual analysis.

Merging & Cleaning

Merged datasets, fixed data types, and handled missing values.

Extracted new features from date columns and calculated units_sold.

Detected and treated outliers.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Analyzed relationships between features and the target.

Feature Engineering

Created features like rolling mean, rolling std, etc.

Statistical Testing

Used ANOVA and P-Values to identify and drop irrelevant features.

Model Building
Trained 4 models:

Prophet

MAE: 8.31

Random Forest

MAE: 7.36 | RÂ²: 0.9917 | RMSE: 8.66

XGBoost

MAE: 7.25 | RÂ²: 0.9920 | RMSE: 8.49

âœ… Best Model after Tuning

Tuned MAE: 7.20, RMSE: 8.47, RÂ²: 0.9921

Linear Regression

MAE: 7.49 | RÂ²: 0.9917 | RMSE: 8.69

Model Selection & Saving

Selected XGBoost as the final model and saved it.

MLflow Integration

Tracked all experiments using MLflow.

Deployment with FastAPI + HTML Form

Deployed the model using FastAPI and built a cool interactive HTML form that allows users to select product, store, and date to generate a forecast easily.

Dynamic Dashboard

Built an interactive dashboard for exploring feature relationships.
