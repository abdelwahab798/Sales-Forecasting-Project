# 🛒 Sales Forecasting and Demand Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict product demand based on historical sales data.  
Accurate forecasting helps businesses optimize inventory management, marketing strategies, and staffing decisions.  

## 🎯 Why This Project?  
This project was chosen because inaccurate demand forecasting is a major challenge for businesses. Poor predictions can lead to:  

- **Overstocking or Understocking** → Causing financial losses and inefficiencies.  
- **Inefficient Marketing Strategies** → Businesses may overspend or underspend on promotions.  
- **Operational Challenges** → Incorrect demand estimation can disrupt supply chain planning.  

### **Project Impact**  
✅ **Improved Forecasting Accuracy** → Helping businesses make data-driven decisions.  
✅ **Optimized Inventory Management** → Reducing losses due to stock mismanagement.  
✅ **Enhanced Business Planning** → Supporting better marketing and supply chain strategies.  

## 🏆 Project Plan  
1️⃣ **Planning** → Defining goals, collecting resources, and understanding project scope.  
2️⃣ **Design** → Structuring the model and selecting appropriate algorithms.  
3️⃣ **Implementation** → Developing the predictive model and processing data.  
4️⃣ **Testing & Evaluation** → Validating model performance and optimizing predictions.  
5️⃣ **Final Documentation & Reporting** → Summarizing findings and preparing a presentation.
