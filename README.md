# ðŸ›’ Sales Forecasting and Demand Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project builds a robust machine learning pipeline to forecast product demand using historical sales data. Accurate demand forecasting enables businesses to make data-driven decisions related to inventory, marketing strategies, and staffing.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project?  
Inaccurate demand forecasting can cause:

- **Overstocking or Understocking** â†’ Financial losses and inefficiencies  
- **Inefficient Marketing** â†’ Misallocation of promotional budgets  
- **Operational Disruptions** â†’ Supply chain mismanagement

## âœ… Project Outcomes  
- Improved Forecast Accuracy  
- Optimized Inventory Management  
- Enhanced Business Strategy

## ðŸš€ Project Pipeline  
We followed a comprehensive data science workflow:

- **Data Visualization**  
  Explored relationships between features using visual tools.

- **Merging & Cleaning**  
  Merged datasets, fixed data types, handled missing values, extracted new date-based features, calculated `units_sold`, and treated outliers.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Analyzed relationships between features and the target variable.

- **Feature Engineering**  
  Created features like rolling mean, rolling standard deviation, etc.

- **Statistical Testing**  
  Applied ANOVA and P-values to remove irrelevant features.

- **Model Building & Evaluation**  

| Model             | MAE   | RÂ²      | RMSE  |
|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|
| Prophet           | 8.31  | â€”       | â€”     |
| Random Forest     | 7.36  | 0.9917  | 8.66  |
| XGBoost           | 7.25  | 0.9920  | 8.49  |
| Linear Regression | 7.49  | 0.9917  | 8.69  |

- **Best Model after Tuning:**  
  - MAE: 7.20  
  - RMSE: 8.47  
  - RÂ²: 0.9921  

- **Model Selection & Saving**  
  Selected XGBoost as the final model.

- **MLflow Integration**  
  Tracked experiments and model versions.

- **Deployment**  
  Deployed with FastAPI and an interactive HTML form allowing users to select product, store, and date for forecasts.

- **Dynamic Dashboard**  
  Created an interactive dashboard to explore feature relationships dynamically.
